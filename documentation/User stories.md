# User stories

As a user, I want to...
- log in to have access to a personalized account **done**
- add tasks so I can keep track of my tasks **done**
- add working periods to keep tracks of my work habits **done**
- attach working periods to tasks to see which tasks are progressing **done**
- evaluate the quality of my working periods to see trends in my work **done**
- attach dates and lengths to working periods to see trends in my work **done**
- mark a task as finished so I can see what I no longer need to work on **done**
- estimate how long a task will take so I can see how good I am at estimating **done**
- estimate my progress while working on a task so I can see how long it will take to finish **done**
- attach tasks to self-defined classes so I can sort my tasks by type **done**
- see automatically made stats to see trends in my work **progressing**

All functionality is there - still lacking stats, sorting, and some polish.
