# Task tracker

Web-based database app.

User can log in to her account and add tasks that she needs to finish. After working on a task, she can log a new working period.
App displays trends in working times, efficiency, how long it takes to complete vs. how long it was estimated to take, etc.

### Features

- User has login credentials
- User can add tasks
  - Tasks can belong to 'classes' specified by the user
    - This way we get cool data, i.e. what kind of tasks are fastest or most efficient to finish
  - At start, user can include an estimate to how long a task will take to finish
    - Once task is finished, we have data on how good the user is at estimating
  - User should keep task's '% done' up to date
    - App calculates how long it will still take to finish
- User can add periods of work
  - User specifies when she worked, for how long, on which project, where, and how efficient it was
- User can view cool data and become more efficient at finishing tasks!

I plan on using the experience gained on this project to improve my existing Android app, Knit Timer!
